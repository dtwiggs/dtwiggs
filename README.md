As a new graduate of Computer Science at Cal State Northridge (CSUN), I am eager to bring my diverse skill set and enthusiasm for technology to the professional world. With proficiency in Java, C#, Unity, and Scala along with a foundation in game design and functional programming, I thrive in collaborative environments and excel in team projects. My senior project, I was contributing to the development of a compiler for NASA JPL through the Autonomy Research Center for STEAHM (ARCS) program at CSUN, where I honed my problem solving abilities and gained invaluable real world experience with access to many capable mentors. Beyond my professional pursuits, I spend my time rock climbing outdoors and volunteering to help maintain the outdoors with rehabilitation projects. I also volunteer with the American Red Cross at their Leadership Development Camp, where I actively contribute to community and youth development. Moving forward from college, I am excited to leverage my skills and experiences to embark on a fulfilling career in technology, and learn as much as possible from those in the field already.
