As a new graduate of Computer Science at Cal State Northridge (CSUN), I am eager to bring my diverse skill set and enthusiasm for technology to the professional world. With proficiency in Java, C#, Unity, and Scala along with a foundation in game design and functional programming, I thrive in collaborative environments and excel in team projects. My senior project, I was contributing to the development of a compiler for NASA JPL through the Autonomy Research Center for STEAHM (ARCS) program at CSUN, where I honed my problem solving abilities and gained invaluable real world experience with access to many capable mentors. Beyond my professional pursuits, I spend my time rock climbing outdoors and volunteering to help maintain the outdoors with rehabilitation projects. I also volunteer with the American Red Cross at their Leadership Development Camp, where I actively contribute to community and youth development. Moving forward from college, I am excited to leverage my skills and experiences to embark on a fulfilling career in technology, and learn as much as possible from those in the field already.

## Skills:
Java / Scala / C# / Unity / Compiler Design

## Projects:
[FPP + Proteus](https://github.com/AlbertoSantana0/ProteusFPP)

Software developer creating a unified compiler integrating the FPP and Proteus modeling languages, in charge of creating the tokenizer and code generator. FPP is a modeling language designed for NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory's F Prime flight software framework, while Proteus is a programming language for actor-based hierarchical state machines. Our work combines the strengths of both languages, enabling seamless integration and efficient compilation for complex aerospace software systems. This integration enhances system reliability, streamlines development workflows, and facilitates the creation of robust and scalable software for space applications.
